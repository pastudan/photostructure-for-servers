# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version of PhotoStructure is supported.

## Responsible disclosure security policy

We consider the security of our users a top priority. But no matter how much effort we put into security, there may still be vulnerabilities present.

## Reporting a security issue

If you find a vulnerability in PhotoStructure, _or even think you have_, please contact us via a **private channel**.
