## Welcome to PhotoStructure!

**Please note that this git repository is not where PhotoStructure handles bug tracking or feature requests.**

First off: apologies if PhotoStructure is misbehaving for you. It's always frustrating when software doesn't "just work."

Please visit the official [PhotoStructure Forum](https://forum.photostructure.com/c/bug/8/l/latest) and see if your bug has already been reported.

If it has, please add any additional context or system information that you think would be helpful in tracking down and solving the issue.

If it hasn't, the more context the better: and if there is information that you'd rather keep private, please email support@photostructure.com with a reference to the bug and those additional details.

Cheers!
